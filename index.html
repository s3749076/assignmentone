<h1>Introduction to Information Technology</h1>
<h2>Assignment 1: My Profile</h2>
	<h3>Personal Information</h3>
	<p>Student Number: s3749076       Email Address: s3749076@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
	<p>Basic background: My name is Harry Oliver, I was born and have lived my entire life in Australia and I only speak English. I studied at Staughton College in Melton South for my secondary education. My main hobby is playing tennis which I have been doing for the last 7 years, other than that I enjoy playing video games, primarily Destiny. I currrently have a dog and a cat.</p>
	<h4>Interest in IT</h4>
	<p><i>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline  your IT experience (if any).</i></p>
<p>My interest in IT is pretty universal regarding the fields I enjoy to engage with, but mainly I am most interested in software development and networking. My interest in software development was sparked from my childhood experiences with video games, from that I became interested in the underlying technology which created such games and this would extent to more general software as I got older. Regarding networking, it’s a very similar situation, attempting to set up LAN networks between home devices to play games like Age of Empires 2 with my family created an interest in the connectivity between devices and what it enables. Spending hours trying to get LAN connections between many devices of varying ages and operating systems challenged me to start learning about home networking at a young age.</p>
	<p><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT as this university offers a course I was interested in available for online study. I chose to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology through online correspondence at RMIT so that I could focus on working and playing tennis, this was enabled by online study as the transit time and scheduled classes that would have normally prevented me from working don’t exist through this online solution for study.</p>
	<p><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></p>
<p>During my studies at RMIT I hope to vastly expand my understanding of IT in the areas I am already familiar, to aid in specialising in the aspects I am most interested and competent in, and to learn about critical areas of IT I am not familiar with. Most importantly I hope to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and skills regarding IT. An example being that I have a decent understanding of basic Python but have had very little experience with Java and the Introduction to Programming unit has helped me gain a fundamental understanding of the language.
	During my current study allocating I expect to gain a general understanding of IT in this unit (introduction to IT) and to learn fundamental programming skills in Java (introduction to Programming).

	<h4>Ideal Job</h4>
	<p><i>The job advertisment itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it</i></p>

<p><i>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
</i></p>
<p>The position advertised by ‘Precision Sourcing’ is that of a Data and Software Developer. As advertised by the employer the job is a data and software developer who would be responsible for working with clients in numerous ways to solve a variety of problems. My interpretation of the role is that the employee would have to not only have a vast variety of skills (Java, SQL, Python, Jenkins, Docker, Unix… etc. etc) but would also have to apply these skills in application to an infinite number of problems. These elements of the position are described in the post being that the employee would have to ‘create your own solutions using a range of software’. Furthermore, the employer expects the applicant to have experience in almost every aspect of IT, listed is coding (python), cloud networking (google), web development (HTML) and numerous other important skills. This position is appealing because it offers an opportunity for the employee to execute numerous skills to solve problems in IT, as long as the employee had fundamental skills I believe this position would offer a chance to solidify those very important skills and open up a lot of opportunities to further a career in the IT industry.
</p>
	<p><i>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
</i></p>
<p>The position requires the applicant to have experience using tools in many different aspects of IT. The ad mentions tools that are used in software, database, and web development must be used with an emphasis on Java in particular. The position is one of ample reward and opportunity and correspondingly has a high requirement of skills. While a tangible estimate of required experience isn’t listed, i.e. ‘2 years software development’, but from the lengthy list of required skills it appears that this position requires a decent amount of education as well as workplace experience.
</p>
<p><i>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you have</i></p>
<p>In regard to skills, I have developed a very basic understanding of python and am currently creating a fundamental grasp of Java through my course at RMIT. My qualifications extent only to my completion of VCE, particularly VCE Informatics, and being in the very early stages of a Bachelor of IT at RMIT.
</p>
	<p><i>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.
</i></p>
<p>The first and most critical development strategy I could pursue would be to complete the Bachelor of IT I am currently studying as it will provide the most fundamental and essential understanding of general IT, and aid in creating the basic skills I need for such a position. In regard to further developing such basic skills and earning the required qualifications and experience I would either have to choose between entering a job with qualifications I would meet at the end of my course then moving on after learning as much as I could from such a position, OR to enter a postgraduate course and sacrifice work experience for learning and consolidating more IT skills within an educational atmosphere. Meanwhile, I could take advantage of semester breaks by using the long breaks to focus on learning how to use new tools in spheres of IT such as web development.

<ul>&#8226 Tactics: (67%) Judging
</ul>
<ul>&#8226 Identity: (53%) Turbulent
</ul>
<p><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i></p>
<p>The results indicate that I have a more introverted, calculated approach to learning and interacting. The results of these tests come at no surprise as I am aware of my approach to learning as being more individual and self motivated, taking placing through reading and rewriting lecture or textbook information and answering practical questioning relevant to such information.
</p>
<p><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviouor in a team?</i></p>
<p>I believe that the results indicate that, unless paid attention to, I will risk disassociating from a group and doing my own individual work (and redoing others work) as it more closely fits my style of learning. Through my understanding of the results I know that I must work to stay engaged with a team and actively attempt to participate as a group as well as use my independent work strengths to full benefit the team.
</p>
<p><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></p>
<p>When forming or joining a team I should seek out others who are either equally as competent at individual work, as to split a project into equal parts then come back together to connect the work pieces into a final solution whilst each editing and critiquing each other’s work, or to find those dependent on team work and need someone else to take a leadership or organiser position in order to push myself out of my comfort zone and to engage in a style of learning I am not familiar.
</p>
<h3>Project</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Upon the conclusion of the 2019 Australian Federal Election I realised a large problem which an IT solution would be most appropriate. During the election cycle candidates from every constituency across the country make claims about their opposition’s plans for government and how their alternative is scientifically and objectively better. From the infinite number of claims and attempts at slandering an oppositions crediantals, comes an impossible contradiction in that how can so many parties and candidates all be right and how can so many polarizing policies addressing the same issue all be perfect? The solution I would put forward is that of a mobile application which would break down the election down to a few key issues, present the policy agenda of differing major parties, then what economists or other experts estimate as being the most positive action to take.
</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>The motivation for this project is that I have always been heavily interested in the political processes of Australia, not for the furthering of any particular dogma or doctrine but rather an appreciation of the democracy we live in and the desire to make the people’s voting right as powerful as possible. I want everyone to vote the way that will benefit them and their family rather than being manipulated by lies and deception spread during the heated election campaigns. I believe if voters had access to the breakdown of individual policy and the opinion of experts they would know which party truly holds the values they care about and would empower the voters to have the government in power that will truly meet their needs, whilst forcing rejected parties to adapt their policies. The audience of this app would be the 16.5 million Australians [4] who are eligible to vote, even if only a few people realise what party actually represents their interests through the project it would be worthwhile.
</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The main features of the app can be defined into three separate sections: The selection of the most popular political parties, the election issues and the policy put forward by the party selected, and how experts assess the policy in regard to effectiveness in addressing the problem.
</p>
<p><u>Part Selection</u></p>
<p>The party selector element of the app would be the initial step when opening the app. The user will be presented with the icon of the party accompanied with the name, leader’s name, deputy leader’s name, and the name of the candidate in their electorate if that information is provided and if such a candidate is running in said electorate. To continue the use of the app the user would have to select a party to further investigate. An example of such a lay out would look like the following.</p>
<img src="App.png" width="603.5" height="433.5"/>
<p>As demonstrated, the user would see the parties logo above its name, leader, deputy and candidate for that area. The area I based the results from is the electorate of Gorton in Victoria’s western suburbs. An example of what an empty candidacy would look like can be seen in the Nationals icon where the candidate is listed as ‘none’  due to the fact that the nationals did not contest the seat of Gorton during the 2019 Federal Election. The parties that will be displayed within this segment of the app are those identified as being major/minor parties by the Parliament of Australia that are still currently active. The list of parties which will be present are: the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, The National Party of Australia, One Nation, Australian Greens, Katter’s Australian Party, Palmer United Party, and the Centre Alliance [5] </p>
<p><u>Election Issues</u></p>
<p>This segment of the app succeeds the party selection screen, at this point the user would follow up the selection of a party with an issue to view that parties policy and the expert analysis. The topics that will be included in this segment of the app would be determined based on the constraints in developing that project, if enough time was given then many more issues would be included. The top issues of the 2019 election, as denoted by the data ABC news published from their Vote Compass project [6], are in descending importance to voters: Environment, Economy, Healthcare, Superannuation and pensions, Employment, Immigration and refugees, Government accountability, Education, Poverty and inequality, Housing and cost of living, LGBTQ rights, Energy, Security, Infrastructure, Freedom of speech/religion, Gender equality, Indigenous issues, and Industrial relations. In a prototype or alpha state the app would feature the first 6 topics as they are the most important to voters and would reduce the workload to a manageable amount. From each of the topics featured the policy of each of the parties listed in the previous section would be provided. Each topic may also be broken down into more specific issues or the policy section would feature numerous policy ideas. Using Environment as an example we would list the party policy for each of the major and minor parties. Here is an example of what would be displayed (ignoring the lack of formating or visual style)
</p>
<img src="App3.png" width="725" height="387"/>
<p> As demonstrated above, depending on what party was selected (column left), then what policy area is selected (column middle) information on what policy said party provides is displayed. The distinction here is that the information to be included should be kept to only physical goals or funding not promises or estimations of what certain unrelated policies would do to impact the environment. It is critical that the importation of these policies within the app is done carefully as propaganda featured within policy outlines cannot be included as it would completely undermine the purpose of the app. 
The above example shows the 3 different outputs possible when a user checks out the policy for any party. The Liberal and Labor party both present their very polar funding outlines, alternatively the National Party refers back to the Liberal policy as their own (as they are a Coalition). The final and least likely output is that the party doesn’t provide any policy for that topic, as demonstrated by the United Australia Party who provided no environmental policy for the 2019 election.
</p>
<p><u>Expert Assessment</u></p>
<p>This final segment of the app would feature an expert opinion of the policy featured in the previous page. This opinion would have to be a critical evaluation of the policy idea and provide an estimation on the effect such a policy would have (if the effect isn’t what the party claims it would be). An example of this is the Climate Council’s criticism of the incumbent Liberal/National government’s Emissions Reduction Fund, saying that “the Federal Government’s climate performance over the past five-years as the defining leadership failure of the past decade” [11] while also providing a graph demonstrating that the Carbon Taxation period demonstrated a decrease in emissions while the Emissions Reduction Fund period say an increase in emissions.</p>
<img src="App4.jpg" width="512" height="415"/>
<p>As demonstrated this segment would have an expert opinion and evidence demonstrating that their policy is either ineffectual in addressing the issue or has no effect. This example shows the Climate Council claiming that the government’s policy direction will not address the issue of carbon emissions whilst providing that the Carbon Tax policy established by the Gillard government had real reductions on carbon emissions.
</p>
<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>In that the project would be a mobile app the software that could be used would include Java, Python, MIT App Inventor, etc. Given that Introduction to Programming uses Java I would probably attempt to utilise Java to develop the app. Regarding Hardware, a computer and a phone would be required. A computer device would be used to develop/program the app whilst the phone would be used to properly demo test the app.
</p>
<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>The skills required would be the ability to use either, python, java, MIT App inventor, or another app developing software tool. More specifically the application of an understanding of the design conventions that need to be implemented into an app which would be hopefully used by those of varying age and education. One of the most critical skills would be the inclusion of accessibility concerns involving the vast variety of potential users, from aged users, to non-enlgish speakers to visually handicapped people a large number of particular of differing disadvantages or problems potential users would have in accessing and appropriately understanding the app and the information it provides.
</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>If the project was successful then the outcome would be very difficult to measure without direct feedback from users as the anonymous nature of voting means there would be no metric of which voters changed voting habits to measure. The most desirable outcome of the project is not to change people’s vote or to influence certain parties into power but rather to empower voters to fully understand the direction the country will take depending on who they cast their votes for. Ultimately the better informed the voting population is the better life will be for every Australian.
